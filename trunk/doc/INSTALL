6. Extend your blog class with new text string attribute called "Send trackbacks to: (Separate multiple URIs with spaces)"
   with id "trackback_urls". If you want use different attribute ID, remeber to change settings/trackback.ini(.append.php) in 
   eztrackback extension directory.

   If this attribute already exists in your blog class, you can skip this part.

   Adjust [BlogClassSettings] in settings/trackback.ini(.append.php) in eztrackback extension directory

        dc:title="{$node.parent.name|wash()}"
        dc:identifier="{$node.url_alias|ezurl( 'no', 'full' )}" />
   </rdf:RDF> 
   -->

8. Give Anonymous User read permissions to 'trackback' module.

9. In extension/eztrackback/settings/trackback.ini(.append.php) file set your blog name and blog class identifier and other settings.

10. For displaying the trackbacks use this code in blog full view template.

    <h2>{"Trackbacks"|i18n("extension/eztrackback")}</h2>

    <div class="content-view-children">
        {foreach fetch_alias( trackbacks, hash( parent_node_id, $node.node_id ) ) as $trackback}
            {node_view_gui view='line' content_node=$trackback}
        {/foreach}
    </div>

Known problems
==============

Trackbacks inside the same installation (database) does not work due a problem with transactions.
Workaround: Disable DatabaseTransactions in DatabaseSettings of site.ini
